A project about finding effective strategies for the 100 dice game

## How 100 works
If you don't know how the game 100 works, it is farly simple. Each player starts with a score of zero and players roll a pair of d6 dice on their turn. Whatever number the dice land on is added to the player's score with two exceptions:
7: When a 7 is rolled, players lose any points they earned that round and end their turn immediately
2: When a 2 is rolled, players lose all of their points (back to 0) and again end their turn immediately.
Players can roll the dice as many times as they want as long as they don't roll a 7 or a 2.
Ending the game: As soon as a player ends their turn with more than 100 points, the final round begins. At this point, everyone else playing gets 1 more turn, in which they must try and score as many points as possible. The player with the most points after everyone has gone wins!
